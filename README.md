# UWCCC.GWAS

This is a general use package with functions to analysis GWAS data at the 
UW - Carbone Cancer Center. I am developing the functions on a by need basis,
and I kinda expect to keep using it for other projects.

To install:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("welch16/UWCCC.GWAS")

```
